          We are a group of students from ISIA U, a School of Higher
          Education in Design and Visual Communication. Our school, like all the others
          in Italy, operates within a system defined by rules that dictate the relationship
          between teachers and students. However, recently ISIA U has launched
          an experimental project to rethink the design teaching, creating an informal
          learning space self-managed by the students. This space is called Rumore.</p>
          <p class="indented-text">
          Managing and being responsible for a space external from
          the school, which however was only possible thanks to the school, immediately
          validated for us the role of the context. It was clear how Rumore set itself
          as a starting point to relate our experiences to other places and scenarios.
          To make this happen, Rumore needed an effort of translation. From a
          static and closed space to a moving and open place: Rumore moves beyond
          the walls that define it and becomes a table capable of moving around the
          city. For us, the table is a tool that allows us to translate a place into a surface
          making it itinerant. Initiating our process within Rumore is as relevant
          as concluding in it, dictating the starting and the end of the full procedure
          enclosed in its space.</p>
          <p class="indented-text">
          On these foundations, our project proposal arises: [...]. Two
          parentheses that underlie a space, this is the sign that defines the identity
          and meaning of our project.</p>
          <p class="indented-text">
          [...] is a mobile concept-space, an exhibition surface and
          at the same time a place for discussion and dialogue. Its function is to occupy
          different spaces of teaching and learning, other classrooms or common
          areas of city faculties, to go out into the common space, to be placed in the
          streets and squares.</p>

            Intention<br>
            </p>
            <p class="indented-text">
              Placing ourselves in the educational context as design students,
              we are reconsidering the methods by which our learning takes place.
              Drawing upon Illich’s theory of deschooling society, we believe that every
              new experience, lived directly in the field, is capable of generating a moment
              of learning to complement our educational path. In this sense, each of our
              perspectives and subjectivities becomes a resource capable of sparking new
              discoveries, when a process of collective analysis and learning is set in motion.</p>
              <p class="indented-text">
                We chose to concentrate our activity in a delimited space
              such as a table in order to break away from Rumore. We believe that our proposal
              is strengthened by the lateral responses that a new context can trigger.</p>
              <p class="indented-text">
                Crucial to our approach was the work of Lucius Burckhardt,
                a sociologist who made strolling a practice of reappropriation of places,
                also from a conceptual point of view. In 1993 in Kessel, he organized “The
                Mobile Zebra Crossing,” which allowed participants to cross a six-lane highway
                wherever they decided to lay down the striped carpet. The proposed activity
                gave back to the residents the possibility to cross the city at any point
                they desired.</p>
                <p class="indented-text">
                  For Burckhardt, the context is nothing but a field of consciousness
                  in which, thanks to interdisciplinary analysis tools, one is able to
                  confront the visible and invisible aspects that constitute it. In this sense, the
                  unpredictability of the generative context only underscores its potential.
                </p>
                  <p class="indented-text">
                    In addition, referring to experiences such as Pedro Reyes’
                    Sanatorium and Conditional Design by Luna Maurer, Edo Paulus, Jonathan
                    Puckey, and Roel Wouters, led us to formulate our proposal according to a
                    structured and programmed methodology.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented-text">
                    Furthermore, fundamental to our reasoning was Macguffin
                    - The Life of Things, a Dutch editorial research project that investigates the
                    life of ordinary things, the unexplored possibilities that objects hold in relation
                    to history, identity, and social relations. As in the experience of Macguffin,
                    the object becomes the expedient to go beyond.

 Objective<br>
  </p>
  <p class="indented-text">

    starting object, by continuously defining it.</p>

      We offer a conceptual field: our brackets. We offer a physical

      starting object, by continuously defining it.</p>
      <p class="indented-text">
        continuously defining it.
        Our sign, [...], which becomes the name and identity, carries
        with it part of the process we want to initiate. The ambiguity that arises
        in pronouncing it already hints at the interpretive possibilities contained
        within a sign. These multiple readings are the ones we want to investigate
        through the activity we propose.</p>
        <p class="indented-text">
          Proposing a laboratory activity such as [...] means exploring
          the relationship between object and knowledge; its success depends entirely
          on the willingness of individuals to take part in the process. In exchange
          for a concrete contribution, those who take part in this becoming will acquire
          a new way of knowing the object. Therefore, for us, the endpoint is the varied
          set of languages, thoughts, and perspectives that, starting from the object,
          also is capable of grasping its more lateral aspects.</p>
          <p class="indented-text">
            [...] is validated when another reality simultaneously initiates
            the same proposal. However, these two ones are not bound to make appointments
            at the same time, but only to share considerations within the defined
            twinning time frame.</p>
            <p class="indented-text">
              The conclusion of the two proposals should occur in synchrony,
              so that there is a synthesis of both experiences. Every reality that engages
              in this activity is invited to contact another at the end of the project.</p><br>

                 <p class="indented-text">
                  The collective work that the table proposes invites participants
                  to develop discussions on identity starting from a fetish object. We
                  call for a plural participation around the surface of the table to allow constant
                  contamination, where the individual readings should be materialized.
                  We confide in the ability of an object to convey knowledge; we believe that
                  this potential can only be unlocked thanks to the subjectivity and cultural
                  identity of each individual. The collective perspective, in this sense, is able to
                  bring forth semantic bridges that could not arise otherwise. The reasoning
                  generated from the object will be influenced by aspects such as the personal
                  heritage of the individual, the role of the context and moment, social barriers,
                  expectations of change, rooting, and relationships.</p>
                  <p class="indented-text">
                    Being [...] an activity that is determined by the spontaneous
                    adhesion of the participants, only the first theme emerges from the project
                    group. The subsequent appointments will originate from the latest contribution
                    produced during the day.</p>
                    <p class="indented-text">
                      All that will be produced from the work done around the
                      table will be tracked in a book-object that captures the controversial identity
                      nature of a place; this editorial will consist of the outputs produced, the
                      activity documentations, and the memorandum drawn up at the end of each
                      event. The book will be a narrative and documentary product returned in
                      an artistic and experimental key that offers an informal and unconventional
                      memoir, capable of bringing out the hidden aspects that the official narrative
                      usually cannot achieve. All stemming from the individual analysis of the
                      starting theme.</p><br>

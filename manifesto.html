           <p class="heading-text">Structure</p>
             <p class="indented-text">We are a group of students from ISIA U, a School of</p>
               <p class="takeAll">Higher Education in Design and Visual Communication. Our school, like all the others
                in Italy, operates within a system defined by rules that dictate the relationship
                between teachers and students. However, recently ISIA U has launched
                an experimental project to rethink the design teaching, creating an informal
                learning space self-managed by the students. This space is called Rumore.</p>
               <p class="indented-text">Managing and being responsible for a space external</p>
               <p class="takeAll">from the school, which however was only possible thanks to the school, immediately
                validated for us the role of the context. It was clear how Rumore set itself
                as a starting point to relate our experiences to other places and scenarios.
                To make this happen, Rumore needed an effort of translation. From a
                static and closed space to a moving and open place: Rumore moves beyond
                the walls that define it and becomes a table capable of moving around the
                city. For us, the table is a tool that allows us to translate a place into a surface
                making it itinerant. Initiating our process within Rumore is as relevant
                as concluding in it, dictating the starting and the end of the full procedure
                enclosed in its space.</p>
               <p class="indented-text">On these foundations, our project proposal arises: [...].</p>
               <p class="takeAll">Two parentheses that underlie a space, this is the sign that defines the identity
                and meaning of our project.</p>
               <p class="indented-text">[...] is a mobile concept-space, an exhibition surface and</p>
               <p class="takeAll" id="gap-para">at the same time a place for discussion and dialogue. Its function is to occupy
                different spaces of teaching and learning, other classrooms or common
                areas of city faculties, to go out into the common space, to be placed in the
                streets and squares.</p>

               <p class="heading-text">Intention</p>
                 <p class="indented-text">Placing ourselves in the educational context as design</p>
                   <p class="takeAll"> students, we are reconsidering the methods by which our learning takes place.
                   Drawing upon Illich’s theory of deschooling society, we believe that every
                   new experience, lived directly in the field, is capable of generating a moment
                   of learning to complement our educational path. In this sense, each of our
                   perspectives and subjectivities becomes a resource capable of sparking new
                   discoveries, when a process of collective analysis and learning is set in motion.</p>
                   <p class="indented-text">We chose to concentrate our activity in a delimited</p>
                   <p class="takeAll">space such as a table in order to break away from Rumore. We believe that our proposal
                   is strengthened by the lateral responses that a new context can trigger.
                    </p>
                   <p class="indented-text">Crucial to our approach was the work of Lucius</p>
                     <p class="takeAll">Burckhardt, a sociologist who made strolling a practice of reappropriation of places,
                     also from a conceptual point of view. In 1993 in Kessel, he organized “The
                     Mobile Zebra Crossing,” which allowed participants to cross a six-lane highway
                     wherever they decided to lay down the striped carpet. The proposed activity
                     gave back to the residents the possibility to cross the city at any point
                     they desired.
                    </p>
                     <p class="indented-text">For Burckhardt, the context is nothing but a field of</p>
                       <p class="takeAll">consciousness in which, thanks to interdisciplinary analysis tools, one is able to
                       confront the visible and invisible aspects that constitute it. In this sense, the
                       unpredictability of the generative context only underscores its potential.

                    <p class="indented-text">
                         In addition, referring to experiences such as Pedro</p>
                        <p class="takeAll">Reyes’ Sanatorium and Conditional Design by Luna Maurer, Edo Paulus, Jonathan
                         Puckey, and Roel Wouters, led us to formulate our proposal according to a
                         structured and programmed methodology.
                       </p>
                      <p class="indented-text">Furthermore, fundamental to our reasoning was</p>
                         <p class="takeAll" id="gap-para">Macguffin The Life of Things, a Dutch editorial research project that investigates the
                         life of ordinary things, the unexplored possibilities that objects hold in relation
                         to history, identity, and social relations. As in the experience of Macguffin,
                         the object becomes the expedient to go beyond.

     <p class="heading-text">Objective</p>
       <p class="indented-text">We offer a conceptual field: our brackets. We offer a</p>
         <p class="takeAll">physical counterpart: the table. In this area, we have only one task: to redefine the
         starting object, by continuously defining it.</p>
             <p class="indented-text">Our sign, [...], which becomes the name and identity,</p>
             <p class="takeAll">carries with it part of the process we want to initiate. The ambiguity that arises
             in pronouncing it already hints at the interpretive possibilities contained
             within a sign. These multiple readings are the ones we want to investigate
             through the activity we propose.</p>
             <p class="indented-text">Proposing a laboratory activity such as [...] means</p>
               <p class="takeAll">exploring the relationship between object and knowledge; its success depends entirely
               on the willingness of individuals to take part in the process. In exchange
               for a concrete contribution, those who take part in this becoming will acquire
               a new way of knowing the object. Therefore, for us, the endpoint is the varied
               set of languages, thoughts, and perspectives that, starting from the object,
               also is capable of grasping its more lateral aspects.</p>
               <p class="indented-text">[...] is validated when another reality simultaneously</p>
                 <p class="takeAll">initiates the same proposal. However, these two ones are not bound to make appointments
                 at the same time, but only to share considerations within the defined
                 twinning time frame.</p>
                 <p class="indented-text">The conclusion of the two proposals should occur in</p>
                   <p class="takeAll" id="gap-para">synchrony, so that there is a synthesis of both experiences. Every reality that engages
                   in this activity is invited to contact another at the end of the project.</p>
                   
      <p class="heading-text">Work method</p>
                      <p class="indented-text">The collective work that the table proposes invites</p>
                       <p class="takeAll">participants to develop discussions on identity starting from a fetish object. We
                       call for a plural participation around the surface of the table to allow constant
                       contamination, where the individual readings should be materialized.
                       We confide in the ability of an object to convey knowledge; we believe that
                       this potential can only be unlocked thanks to the subjectivity and cultural
                       identity of each individual. The collective perspective, in this sense, is able to
                       bring forth semantic bridges that could not arise otherwise. The reasoning
                       generated from the object will be influenced by aspects such as the personal
                       heritage of the individual, the role of the context and moment, social barriers,
                       expectations of change, rooting, and relationships.</p>
                       <p class="indented-text">Being [...] an activity that is determined by the</p>
                         <p class="takeAll">spontaneous adhesion of the participants, only the first theme emerges from the project
                         group. The subsequent appointments will originate from the latest contribution
                         produced during the day.</p>
                         <p class="indented-text">All that will be produced from the work done around</p>

                           an artistic and experimental key that offers an informal and unconventional
                           memoir, capable of bringing out the hidden aspects that the official narrative
                           usually cannot achieve. All stemming from the individual analysis of the

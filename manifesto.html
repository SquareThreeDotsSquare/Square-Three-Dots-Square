Our school, like all the othersin Italy, operates within a system defined by rules that dictate the relationship between teachers and students. However, recently ISIA U has launchedan experimental project to rethink the design teaching, creating an informallearning space self-managed by the students. This space is called Rumore.
        <br>
        <h1 id="w-node-b73b1bcd-877d-01ed-a814-2c904b7757ef-82d138a8" class="heading-2">Intention</h1>
        Placing ourselves in the educational context as design students, we are
        reconsidering the methods by which our learning takes place. Drawing upon
        Illich’s theory of deschooling society, we believe that every new experience,
        lived directly in the field, is capable of generating a moment of learning to
        complement our educational path. In this sense, each of our perspectives and
        subjectivities becomes a resource capable of sparking new discoveries, when
        a process of collective analysis and learning is set in motion.
        We chose to concentrate our activity in a delimited space such as
        a table in order to break away from Rumore. We believe that our proposal is
        strengthened by the lateral responses that a new context can trigger.
        Crucial to our approach was the work of Lucius Burkhardt, a sociologist
        who made strolling a practice of reappropriation of places, also from a
        conceptual point of view. In 1993 in Kessel, he organized “The ZEBRAcrossing,”
        which allowed participants to cross a six-lane highway wherever they decided
        to lay down the striped carpet. The proposed activity gave back to the
        residents the possibility to cross the city at any point they desired.
        For Burkhardt, the context is nothing but a field of consciousness in
        which, thanks to interdisciplinary analysis tools, one is able to confront the
        visible and invisible aspects that constitute it. In this sense, the unpredictability
        of the generative context only underscores its potential.
        In addition, referring to experiences such as Pedro Rays’ Sanatorium
        and Conditional Design by Luna Maurer, Edo Paulus, Jonathan Puckey,
        and Roel Wouters, led us to formulate our proposal according to a structured and
        programmed methodology.
        Furthermore, fundamental to our reasoning was Macguffin - The Life of
        Things, a Dutch editorial research project that investigates the life of ordinary
        things, the unexplored possibilities that objects hold in relation to history
        identity, and social relations. As in the experience of Macguffin, the object
        becomes the expedient to go beyond.   <br>   <br>

            We offer a conceptual field: our brackets. We offer a physical counterpart:
            the table. In this area, we have only one task: to redefine the starting object, by
            continuously defining it. Our sign, [...], which becomes the name and identity,
            carries with it part of the process we want to initiate. The ambiguity that arises
            in pronouncing it already hints at the interpretive possibilities contained within
            a sign. These multiple readings are the ones we want to investigate through the
            activity we propose.
            Proposing a laboratory activity such as [...] means exploring the
            relationship between object and knowledge; its success depends entirely
            on the willingness of individuals to take part in the process. In exchange for a
            concrete contribution, those who take part in this becoming will acquire a new
            way of knowing the object. Therefore, for us, the endpoint is the varied set of
            languages, thoughts, and perspectives that, starting from the object, also is
            capable of grasping its more lateral aspects.
            [...] is validated when another reality simultaneously initiates the same
            proposal. However, these two ones are not bound to make appointments at
            the same time, but only to share considerations within the defined twinnin
            time frame. The conclusion of the two proposals should occur in synchrony, so
            that there is a synthesis of both experiences. Every reality that engages in this
            activity is invited to contact another at the end of the project.      <br>   <br>

            <h1 id="w-node-b73b1bcd-877d-01ed-a814-2c904b7757ef-82d138a8" class="heading-2">Work method</h1>
      The collective work that the table proposes invites participants to develop
      discussions on identity starting from a fetish object. We call for a plural
      participation around the surface of the table to allow constant contamination,
      where the individual readings should be materialized. We confide in the ability
      of an object to convey knowledge; we believe that this potential can only be
      unlocked thanks to the subjectivity and cultural identity of each individual. The
      collective perspective, in this sense, is able to bring forth semantic bridges that
      could not arise otherwise. The reasoning generated from the object will be
      influenced by aspects such as the personal heritage of the individual, the role
      of the context and moment, social barriers, expectations of change, rooting,
      and relationships.
      Being [...] an activity that is determined by the spontaneous adhesion of
      the participants, only the first theme emerges from the project group. The
      subsequent appointments will originate from the latest contribution produced
      during the day.
      All that will be produced from the work done around the table will be
      tracked in a book-object that captures the controversial identity nature
      of a place; this editorial will consist of the outputs produced, the activity
      documentations, and the memorandum drawn up at the end of each event.
      The book will be a narrative and documentary product returned in an
      artistic and experimental key that offers an informal and unconventional
      memoir, capable of bringing out the hidden aspects that the official narrative
      usually cannot achieve.
      All stemming from the individual analysis of the starting theme.   <br>   <br>

    Rules are the path we take together, they are the foundation for reforming<br>
    the pedagogical process.
    <br>
    1.	Today we start from [...]<br>
    2.	The object we start with is the only one that is declared.<br>
        What happens is free to be interpreted.<br>
    3.	The object is never the object, but it is the relationships it is made of.<br>
    4.	The process is our result.<br>
    5.	We investigate relationships, we spark semantic leaps.<br>
    6.	There are no mistakes.<br>
    7.	What is necessary is your point of view.<br>
    8.	The moment you arrive is always right.<br>
    9.	You can use everything that is available.<br>
    10.	Your contribution, in whatever form it takes, is always appropriate.<br>
    11.	If you have a doubt, express it.<br>
    12.	Stay for as long as you deem appropriate.<br>
    13.	Tomorrow we will start from [...].
    <br>   <br>
    <h1 id="w-node-b73b1bcd-877d-01ed-a814-2c904b7757ef-82d138a8" class="heading-2">Process</h1>

    [...] is a workshop proposal that extends over several sessions. The first
    step is to define the venue where this activity can take place, taking into
    consideration their cultural relevance (libraries, theatres, museums, schools
    ...). Once permission has been granted by the location in the area of interest,
    the notification of the date, time, and position must be transmitted through
    one’s communication channels (a template will be provided with the necessary
    details and design system for each event). The communication will include the
    theme to be addressed.
    Upon arrival at the designated location, set up the table and position the
    necessary tools in the designated areas. Welcome participants by introducing
    the project, read the manifesto, and explain the objectives.
    Welcome sessions will be held every hour.
    The activity begins.
    Participants create contributions independently using the given tools.
    Record each completed contribution, keeping track of time data through
    scanning. Upload the scanned results into the online platform.
    Repeat the welcoming, production, recording, and uploading phases till
    the end of the activity.
    Conclusion of the activity: discovery of the next theme.
    Draw up a logbook documenting the pros and cons encountered during
    the proposal. Make the necessary modifications to your methodology to
    overcome the challenges faced.
    After all the scheduled sessions have been completed, draft an editorial
    project that serves as a documentative and educational tool.
